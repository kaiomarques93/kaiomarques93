👋 Hi there! I'm Kaio Alexandre Marques — a Full Stack Developer and Data Scientist passionate about building scalable web and mobile applications that solve real-world problems.

💻 I work primarily with **TypeScript**, **Python**, **React**, **Next.js**, and **React Native**, creating high-performance user interfaces and robust backend systems using **Flask**, **FastAPI**, **Django**, **Express**, and **NestJS**.

🔍 I also have strong experience in **Machine Learning**, **NLP**, and **data visualization**, turning complex data into actionable insights. I'm comfortable working with **SQL/NoSQL databases**, setting up **CI/CD pipelines**, and deploying solutions to **AWS**.

🌐 I love contributing to clean, well-documented, and maintainable code, and I'm always looking to learn, collaborate, and build tools that make a difference.
